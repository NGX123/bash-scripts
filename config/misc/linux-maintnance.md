# Linux Maintnance Guide
## General
* Remove dotfiles and dotdirectories(e.g. .file) after removing an application
* Remove bloat apps(Unused apps that are manually installed and not a part of the OS)
* Keep track of OS's RAM usage as big usage means problems with OS or the computer(too much should not be used). Use free command(e.g. free -h) as it is the most accurate source of RAM usage information and mostly comes with the distributions
* Constantly remove usless files from directories like downloads, documents...


## Security
* Update kernel and all packages(e.g. sudo dnf update)
* When downloading strange files, do it only on a virtual machine
